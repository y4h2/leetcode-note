heap

优先days较小的


```py
class Solution:
    def eatenApples(self, apples: List[int], days: List[int]) -> int:
        heap = []
        
        n = len(apples)
        result = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        
        while i < n or heap:
            if i < n and apples[i] > 0:
                heapq.heappush(heap, [days[i] + i, apples[i]])

            # 剔除已经腐烂的苹果
            while heap and (heap[0][0] <= i or heap[0][1] <= 0):
                heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            if heap:
                day, apple = heapq.heappop(heap)
                result += 1
                if apple - 1 > 0:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, [day, apple - 1])
                    
            
            i += 1
            
            
        return result
